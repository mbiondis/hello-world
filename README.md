# hello-world

Martin here! I like to think myself as a midway between a world adventurer and a structured engineer. I love sports (especially football) graphic design, programming and reading about history. 

There are two things that bring me the greatest joy: travelling the world and soaking up the culture from the people that live there, and doing complex electronics projects from scratch.

My current goal in life is to be able to turn these two things into my financial support, so as to achieve the level of "freedom" I strive for (at least for now...).
